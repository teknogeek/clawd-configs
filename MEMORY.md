# MEMORY.md — Long-term curated memory (PRIVATE)

This file is the assistant’s *long-term* memory for Joel.

## Rules
- **Only load in main/private (DM) sessions** with Joel.
- **Do not load in Discord channels / group chats.**
- Keep it curated: decisions, preferences, stable facts. Avoid raw logs.
- Avoid secrets; store secret references in 1Password / `tools/*` docs instead.

## Known preferences / working norms
- Tone: blunt, competent, minimal fluff.
- Security-conscious: don’t leak sensitive info in public; prefer 1Password for secrets.
- “Chill buddy” by default; switch to engineer/runbook mode when asked or when things are breaking.

## Durable technical notes (high level)
- Network debugging: trust **ping loss/jitter** under load more than speedtests.
