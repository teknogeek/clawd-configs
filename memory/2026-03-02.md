# 2026-03-02 — durable notes

## Final resolution (as reported by Joel)
- Root cause of LAN degradation during seedbox torrenting was **UDM-SE CPU/packet-processing saturation**, primarily from:
  - **IDS/IPS (Suricata) HIGH mode**
  - **Traffic Identification / DPI**
  - `ksoftirqd` pegging under high PPS
- Fix: disable **IDS/IPS** and **Traffic Identification/DPI**.
- Working VPN/torrent config: **Mullvad WireGuard Boston relay**, **Quantum Resistance ON**, **MTU 1380**, qB peers reduced (~100 global / 30 per-torrent). Achieved ~80–100 MiB/s sustained with 0% loss per Joel.

## Other key lessons
- Do not trust speedtests alone; use **ping loss/jitter** as the canary.
- Previously found a major physical issue: ONT→UDM cable had swapped pairs; fixing termination restored baseline stability.
- NordVPN had an observed “loss cliff” during earlier testing; ultimately CPU features on the UDM were the controlling factor in final fix.

## Behavioral / comms feedback from Joel
- Joel wants a more chill “buddy” vibe.
- Avoid presenting “menus”/configuration-choice lists in normal conversation; match energy. Switch to engineer/runbook mode only when things are on fire or explicitly requested.
- Don’t respond to every message with a last-word acknowledgement.
