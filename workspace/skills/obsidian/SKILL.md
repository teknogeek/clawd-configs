# Obsidian

Obsidian vault = a normal folder on disk.

Vault structure (typical)

- Notes: `*.md` (plain text Markdown; edit with any editor)
- Config: `.obsidian/` (workspace + plugin settings; usually don’t touch from scripts)
- Canvases: `*.canvas` (JSON)
- Attachments: whatever folder you chose in Obsidian settings (images/PDFs/etc.)

## CLI naming / migration

- Preferred CLI is `notesmd-cli` (renamed from `obsidian-cli`).
- If a host still has only `obsidian-cli`, migrate or use a temporary shim/alias.

## Find the active vault(s)

Obsidian desktop tracks vaults here (source of truth):

- `~/Library/Application Support/obsidian/obsidian.json`

`notesmd-cli` resolves vaults from that file; vault name is typically the **folder name** (path suffix).

Fast “what vault is active / where are the notes?”

- If you’ve already set a default: `notesmd-cli print-default --path-only`
- Otherwise, read `~/Library/Application Support/obsidian/obsidian.json` and use the vault entry with `"open": true`.

Notes

- Multiple vaults common (iCloud vs `~/Documents`, work/personal, etc.). Don’t guess; read config.
- Avoid writing hardcoded vault paths into scripts; prefer reading the config or using `print-default`.
- On headless hosts without Obsidian Desktop metadata, operate directly on known vault paths.

## notesmd-cli quick start

Pick a default vault (once):

- `notesmd-cli set-default "<vault-folder-name>"`
- `notesmd-cli print-default` / `notesmd-cli print-default --path-only`

Search

- `notesmd-cli search "query"` (note names)
- `notesmd-cli search-content "query"` (inside notes; shows snippets + lines)

Create

- `notesmd-cli create "Folder/New note" --content "..." --open`
- Requires Obsidian URI handler (`obsidian://…`) working (Obsidian installed).
- Avoid creating notes under “hidden” dot-folders (e.g. `.something/...`) via URI; Obsidian may refuse.

Move/rename (safe refactor)

- `notesmd-cli move "old/path/note" "new/path/note"`
- Updates `[[wikilinks]]` and common Markdown links across the vault (this is the main win vs `mv`).

Delete

- `notesmd-cli delete "path/note"`

Prefer direct edits when appropriate: open the `.md` file and change it; Obsidian will pick it up.
